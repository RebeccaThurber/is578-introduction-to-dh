I decided to use this assignment as a headstart on my DH Workshop project by analyzing a corpus composed of three translations of Anton Chekhov’s short story “Rothschild’s Fiddle.” In general & in summary I found Voyant Tools to be good for exploring my corpus, while WordCounter was more useful for extracting word frequency counts. I found that I had better success with both tools when I worked with them in conjunction. In order to do anything with the data I pulled from WordCounter, I needed to have a plan/question in mind.
